To python, \"Nadmierne\" and \"nadmierne\" are not the same thing, so when we will want to count how of it appears in our sample later, these would result in seperate counts. So another common first step when working with text data is to treat everything as lowercase and once again string objects provide us with a method that will turn the string to lowercase - lower(). This is good moment to introduce what is called chaining, which is a neat feature of python's syntax that allows us to chain together method calls, such that the output of the first method is the input to the next and so forth.

    "\n",
    "Like most programming languages, Python allows to use code that is not defined in the current script, but in other Python files (\\*.py). A file that code can be imported from is called a *module* and several modules can be organized into a *package* - you can think of these as loosely corresponding to folders on your operating system (packages) and files within them (modules). Just like folders can contain subfolders, packages can contain subpackages. Code can be imported from a package, a subpackage or a specific module. This results in a hierarchical organization that allows to neatly organize code repositories in sensible ways and enforces clarity as to where a piece of code was defined (unlike the *Where does this random function come from?* in R).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two ways of importing a module or a package. The first is a full import, which the solution above uses. The statement translates to \"import *everything* from the string module\", which is one of the standard modules that Python comes shipped with. To stick with the explicitness, everything that is imported from the string module is now bound to the variable called string and we can access each individual definition from it with a dot. In the string module, there is a character string defined that is called \"punctuation\", which we can consequently access now as string.punctuation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because packages can become very big and we will usually only need some of the functionality that a package provides, we can also be more specific about what we want to import. As we are only interested in the punctuation string, we can import just that part of the module like so:"

Our own variable would be lost, because the name points only to the last thing it was assigned to.

In our case, this happens in case any of the current word's characters is identified as a punctuation mark (in which case it will be found in the punctuation string, so the if condition evaluates to True and the break statement gets executed).\n",

    "If you've run through all the code so far, you might have noticed that creating the vocabulary this way takes quite a while to run, while everything else has returned instantly. Now even though we are dealing with a million lines and doing a couple of operations on each of them, this is taking a lot longer than it should and the reason is that a list is the wrong data structure to use here. Instead of just providing the right data structure, we will use this opportunity to go into some detail about what is happening in the background and why it is so slow, as understanding this will come in quite handy later on, even if it is a bit off track right now.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that what our code does is it creates a list object and then, for each word in our sample, it does two things - it (1) searches for that word in the list and (2) appends it otherwise. Lists are generally a very useful data structure and part of virtually every programming language. We will contrast lists from arrays to understand why lists are implemented the way they are and how that results in a bad fit to our task requirements to then eventually move on to a better suited data structure - a set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's first talk about arrays. An array is a way of storing a collection of items *of the same type*, like a list of numbers (list in the natural language sense, not in the data structure sense!). The inner workings are very simple, we specify in advance how many numbers we want to store and the language will reserve a block of memory that can hold exactly that many numbers. Say our list of numbers is actually integers. Integers are often stored with 32 bits (4 bytes), so a sequence of thirty-two 1s and 0s, with the first bit containing the sign and the remaining 31 containing the number in binary. If our list consists of 100 integers, we will need 32000 bits. So the language will reserve that and then we can put our integers into the array, so we can say something like our_array[5] = 100. What happens now and what makes arrays really fast for accessing a specific index is that, because we know how much memory each element takes, we can figure our easily where *any* element is located. For accessing the fifth element, we know that the first four elements require 4\\*32=128 bits. So clearly, the fifth element will be stored in the bits from 129 to 160, which can then be set to 00000000 00000000 00000000 01100100. In other words the time it takes to access an element is independent of the number of elements in the list (constant time). Iterating through the array is equally straightforward, all that is required is returning the contiguous block of memory in steps of 32 bits.\n",
    "\n",
    "So arrays allow us to easily iterate, quickly access individual elements and be very economical, as we really only store the actual bits for the integers and have very little overhead (basically just the information that this variable is a list, how many elements it has in total, the type of the element stored and the memory address pointing to the beginning of the reserved block of memory).\n",
    "\n",
    "One drawback is that we can only store elements of the same type. Clearly, calculating where anything is located in our block of memory wouldn't work if some of the stored elements require 32 bits, while others require only 8 bits, let alone dynamically sized objects like a string (which can be of any length and consequently size). Another is that adding an element will be comparably slow, because we can only reserve a specific amount of memory and now that we need more the memory right after that block might be used by something else - we might be lucky and there is more memory available after the reserved block (in which case we could simply reserve the next 32 bits), but if we're not lucky we need to reserve a new block of memory somewhere else and move all the stored elements there. And if we were to delete or insert something in the middle of our array, then even if there is extra memory space, we will need to move all the elements after the insertion or deletion point one step. If the elements that are stored in the array are big objects, then moving them can be quite costly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we can contrast this with lists. A classical way of implementing a list would be what is called a linked list. In a linked list, no block of memory is specified in advance and the variable name we have given to our list would not point to the beginning of the memory block, but instead point to the first element of the list. Let's say we still have our list of integers, so the variable would contain the memory address of the first number in the list. Except that what is stored at that memory location in a linked list is a bit more elaborated than it was for the array. In particular it will contain not only the integer itself, but one more thing - a link to the *next* element in the list (again just the memory address). That element in turn provides a link to the one that follows it and so forth, until the last element points to a special end of the list element.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see what that does for us. Iterating through the list is still easy, it just involves returning each integer representation and then following the link to the next element until the end is encountered. Appending an element simply involves changing the link of the last element to the appened one and pointing from there to the end of the list. Deleting only requires to change the link from the element before the deleted one to point to the one after it instead. And insertion requires two changes, so that the element before points to the new element and the new element points to the next one. In other words no contiguous block of memory needs to be allocated, so the number of elements does not need to be specified in advance, there is no reason for all elements to have the same size and nothing ever needs to be moved.\n",
    "\n",
    "Linked lists also have some very serious drawbacks. In particular we cannot calculate where any element is located. To access the 100th element, we need to start at the first one and then follow 99 links to get to the target. For a large number of elements, this will be really slow. For appending to the list, in theory this would also hold (we would have to go through all elements), but a more clever implementation will not only remember the first, but also the last element, which makes appending fast and constant in time. Keeping links not only to the next, but also to the previous element makes traversing the list faster as well, but the general problem remains that accessing and changing the list will get significantly slower the bigger it gets.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This implementation also comes with the same drawbacks as the regular array, namely that the number of elements has to be chosen in advance, so that memory for the pointers can be allocated accordingly. But because pointers are cheap (in terms of memory size), Python can be clever about it and over-allocate, so that when a list is created with two elements, it actually allocates a block that can store the memory adresses for four elements. And once that is exceeded, it will reallocate so that it has now room for 8 elements. The overallocation is proportional to the size of the list, so that as the list grows bigger, memory for ever more addiIn Python, unlike what their name would suggest, lists are not actually imlemented as linked lists. Instead they are arrays. Importantly, they are not arrays of the stored objects themselves, but arrays of pointers to the objects (pointers are what memory locations are usually termed in this context). This has two huge advantages. The first is that we know the size of a pointer (8 bytes on 64-bit operating systems), so just like with a regular array we can calculate where any element's memory address is stored, which means that accessing that element is just as quick as in a regular array (+ following that one link to the memory location). The other advantage is that the stored elements can be of any size and live anywhere in memory, because all that is stored is the pointer, which always has the same size.\n",
    "tional elements will be over allocated. The pattern for the first allocation looks like this: 0, 4, 8, 16, 25, 35, 46, 58, 72, 88, ...\n",
    "\n",
    "What this results in is that the time it takes appending to the list amortizes, meaning that if we append a lot to a list, the number of times it will need to be resized decreases, which leads to constant time for appending.\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay. So we know what a list looks like. Now think about what the problem is in our task before you continue reading.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem should be obvious. Appending is fast, so that can't be it. But how can Python know whether the list contains any given item? It will have to bite the bullet and compare each and every element in the list to the item in question. As our vocabulary grows, the time it takes to do that will also grow - exponentially! Our example only goes through a million candidates and the vocabulary size is some fifty thousand by the end - on a real corpus, we will deal with two orders of magnitude more data - our program might take weeks to complete. Clearly, we need another data structure, as lists and arrays will have the same problem here.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data structure we need is a set. Just like in mathematics, a set is an *unordered* collection of *unique* items. Let's see it in action and then talk about it some more."

    "This returned a lot faster, didn't it. The output is the same and most of the syntax is as well. Being a type of collection, sets allow iteration, sorting and the addition of elements. Unlike a list, however, because sets are unordered, iterating over them will return the collected elements in *some* order, but not in the order in which they have been added to them. And even though we can use the sorted function on a set, the object returned by that function (vocabulary_sorted) is a list, because sets, by definition, cannot have order. And because they don't have order, appending (as in add to the end) does not make sense and consequently they provide an .add() function instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "How come sets are so fast here? We have talked about implementational details quite a lot so far, but sets are so clever that we will should understand how they work as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that the problem before was that we had to go through the whole list in order to verify that an item is not included already. Imagine that instead we stored our vocabulary in several sublists, so that each list would contain only a fraction of the vocabulary. Let's call these sublists buckets. If we now knew what bucket any given item would be in, had we seen it, we would only need to go through that bucket and none of the others, cutting the number of elements we will have to check considerably. Try to think of a way you would do that (without worrying about how you could implement it).\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, we are dealing with words. And as we have made sure of with our regular expression, we know what letters these can potentially consist of. So a simple way of realizing our idea would be to have a bucket for each letter of the alphabet and then put every word in that bucket that corresponds to the letter that the word starts with. And whenever we want to know whether we have seen a word, we will only need to check all the words we know that start with the same letter. This *would* work. But we can be yet a bit more clever about it.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we take a step back, then our solution involved a very fast mapping from a large set of things (the words) to a much smaller set (the letters they start with) and a bucket for each of the latter (letter?). Let's think about what could be potentially suboptimal about our specific approach. How is anything in language distributed? Definitely not uniformly. If words are very likely to begin with some letters and very unlikely to begin with others, then the time we save this way will be greatly reduced, because we will spend most time searching through the high-frequency buckets and those buckets will also contain the most elements. That's not great. And even if it were distributed uniformly, it would divide the number of operations required by the number of elements in the alphabet, but as the number of items we store increases, this advantage will vanish. Finally, our solution is specific to the alphabet (we could solve that by creating a bucket for any unicode character) but more importantly it is also specific to character strings. What if we want to keep track of numbers too? What if we have ducks? What if we want to keep track of ducks?\n",
    "\n",
    "So we want a different mapping function. One that is fast (if it takes forever to figure out which bucket to look into, then we might as well spend that time looking through the whole list), works on a range of different types of data, maps it onto an appropriate range of values and is as uniformly distributed in its range as possible, meaning that when we feed an arbitrary item to the function, then we should have equal probability of seeing each possible result (and look into the corresponding bucket) and there should be enough results to keep the size of the bucket appropriately small. Luckily, there is a type of function that is the perfect fit for our needs - hash functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will not bother understanding the (super interesting!) details of how these work, but they have the properties we need. They take an arbitrarily sized input of various types and uniformly map them to an appropriate fixed range of values - the input's *hash*. Hashing functions are vital to cryptography, as they, for example, allow to verify that a password entered into a system is the right one (by comparing its hash to the stored has on the system, meaning that the password itself will never need to be stored and cannot be leaked) and this comes with the neat side-effect that they are well understood, meaning that hashing for sets will be very efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "So that's basically all there is to know about the internal workings of sets. They come with a hashing function and a number of buckets, so that every input gets hashed and stored or looked up in the bucket for the input's hash. Similar to how lists get resized, Python will use a hashing function that is appropriate for the number of elements the set stores, so that once there are so many elements that the size of each bucket becomes too large (meaning that it will take too much time to go through it), it will switch to another hashing function with a bigger range and rehash all the values it has seen before. In the limit, this will result in constant time for lookups and insertions - it'll be very fast.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Counting\n",
    "\n",
    "Finding all the unique words (types) in our sample is great, but typically we will want a bit more than that. Sets won't get us very far if we are interested in the token frequency of each type, as they make no note of how often anything was encountered. Using a plain list with all the tokens had the information we need, but was too slow and very wasteful, as for counting there is no need of actually storing all of the token. What we need is something that tells us what types there are and for each type gives us the token frequency. Mathematically, what we are want is a multiset.\n",
    "\n",
    "In programming languages, this functionality is provided by hash maps or hash tables. In Python this is called a *dictionary*. A dictionary is very similar to a set (the name hash map might have tipped you off) in that it uses hashes and buckets to keep track of the things it contains. But instead of storing inputs in a bucket corresponding to the input's hash, dictionaries store pairs of keys and values. The key corresponds to the input, just as the set. The value is the extra bit that a dictionary provides and it is something that can be stored in the dictionary and that is uniquely identified by the key. In other words we can provide the dictionary with a key and a value and then query the dictionary just with the key and it will return the value. In that way it is similar to a list, but instead of using an index, we give each value a unique identifier (like a name) that we can use to access it.\n",

Let's write a function that takes key-value pair and returns the value, so the list will get sorted by that.\n",

    "Well that didn't work. The error message is interesting, it tells us that the object we're trying to add to the dictionary (a list) is not hashable. Remember that sets and dictionaries internally use hashing to store their items. The problem with lists is that they are meant to be dynamic, so we would expect that a list used somewhere in a piece of code has a fair chance of getting modified somewhere else in the code. But if the list changes, its hash will also likely change. So if we have a dictionary with lists as keys (for example to keep track of some information about the list, such that dictionary\\[my_list\\] = some_information_about_my_list), then after modifying it, the dictionary will look into a different bucket when queried with our list. In other words dictionary\\[my_list\\] != dictionary\\[my_list_later\\]. So the dictionary has no way of telling whether it has seen a list before or not, if it has changed.\n",

This is a good moment to point to a difference between strings and lists. So far, we have treated strings as basically being lists (of letters) with some extra functionality, so that methods for lists are also methods for strings. But that's not quite true. Obviously they differ in that we were able to put strings into sets and dictionaries, but not lists. The reason is that strings are *immutable*, i.e. once a string object is created, it cannot be modified.\n",

    "Again, we only get to modifying the list, but not the string. This time python is a bit more explicit and tells us that item assignment is not allowed for string objects. Now you may be wondering how come we were able to modify strings before, since we did strip off whitespaces from our lines and put them to lowercase. If you go back and look at the code, you might see how come we were able to modify our strings. (Hint: We didn't.)\n",

    "In general, functions that leave their arguments unmodified and return whatever they do modify are much easier to reason over, so I generally prefer them, but sometimes it is simply not possible or computationally inefficient to retain two copies of a data structure, like when you have a large matrix and need to add some value to all of its elements - unless you still need to work with the original data, it is much more effcient to modify the values *in-place*.

To see why, let's briefly summarize what python does when we store something in a variable.\n",

    "When we execute *x = 8675309*, python does not actually *store* the value 8675309 in x. Instead, the thing on the left of the assignment operator now points to the thing on the right. In this case, this means that python will create an integer object (8575309) and the variable x now points to that object. This difference becomes important when we next execute *also_x = x*. If python stored a value on assignment, then there would now be two integer objects, both with the value 8675309 and contained in one of the variables. But there aren't. There is only integer object and both variables point to it. This state of affairs leads to a very common pitfall in python. Let's play a little game.\n",
